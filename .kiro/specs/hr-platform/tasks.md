  - _Requirements: 19.4, 4.4, 21.2_

- [ ] 4. Policy engine
- [ ] 4.1 Implement the 3-level cascade policy resolver as a pure function that deep-merges company, group, and employee policy layers
  - Build a deep-merge utility that handles nested objects: lower levels override higher levels field-by-field. Arrays are REPLACED (not appended) — if a group defines an allowance list, it replaces the company-wide list entirely. This prevents unintended duplication of allowance types or leave types across cascade levels
  - Implement the resolver that accepts company, group, and user policy data and returns a fully resolved effective policy
  - Support effective_from date filtering so policies activate only after their configured date
  - Ensure the resolver has zero side effects — it receives data, returns merged result
  - Write TDD tests: single-level, two-level, three-level cascades, missing levels, date-based filtering, deeply nested overrides
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6_

- [ ] 4.2 (P) Create seed policy data for Japanese labor law and Nepal contractor defaults
  - Build the company-level org.json seed with default values for hours (daily/weekly/monthly minimums), leave (JP standard schedule, NP 1 day/month after 3 months), overtime (JP rates: 1.25x, late night +0.25x, holiday 1.35x, 60h+ 1.5x), compensation, probation (3 months default), and flag configuration
  - Create group-level seed files for each employment type: JP full-time, JP contract, JP outsourced, JP part-time, JP sales, JP intern, NP full-time, NP paid intern, NP unpaid intern
  - Each group file contains only the fields that differ from the company default (sparse overrides)
  - Include 36 Agreement limits (45h/month, 360h/year) in overtime config
  - Include deemed overtime (minashi zangyo) defaults (45h) for applicable JP groups
  - Write tests verifying seed data resolves correctly through the cascade
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.5, 4.7, 8.3, 8.5_

- [ ] 4.3 Define the policy coverage schema ensuring all configurable domains are represented
  - Hours policy: daily/weekly/monthly minimums, work arrangement (remote/office/hybrid), time type (fixed/flex/full-flex), core hours
  - Leave policy: accrual schedule, start condition, cap, carry-over rules, leave types list, mandatory usage rules (JP 5-day), termination handling
  - Overtime policy: deemed overtime hours, pay rates by category, tracking thresholds
  - Compensation policy: salary type (monthly/annual), bonus schedule and timing, allowance definitions, commission tracking
  - Probation policy: duration, leave rules during probation, notice period
  - Flag policy: thresholds per level, grace periods, behaviors per employment type
  - Payment policy: payment deadline date per team (default: end of following month for JP, 15th for NP), alert days before deadline, final settlement deadline (15th of month following termination)
  - Report policy: daily report submission deadline time per team/group (configurable), reminder trigger time

  - Implement role comparison that respects hierarchy ordering
  - Support custom roles with explicitly listed permission strings (e.g., "payroll:read", "leave:approve", "holiday:manage")
  - Build a permission check function that evaluates: does this actor's role or custom permissions allow this action?
  - Super Admin bypasses all permission checks
  - Multiple users can hold the Admin role
  - Write TDD tests for hierarchy checks, custom role permissions, Super Admin override, multiple admins
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7_

- [ ] 5.2 Implement the ABAC system that evaluates reporting chain, resource ownership, and data sensitivity
  - Build attribute evaluation: given an actor context and resource context, determine if the actor has access
  - Manager scope: a manager can only access data for employees where manager_id matches their own ID
  - Resource ownership: employees can access their own data regardless of role
  - Data sensitivity: CONFIDENTIAL data (salary, payroll) requires Manager+ or Admin role; PUBLIC data (name, leave calendar presence) is visible to all
  - Combine RBAC and ABAC into a single authorize function that returns allowed/denied with a reason
  - Write TDD tests: manager accessing direct report (allow), manager accessing non-report (deny), employee accessing own data (allow), employee accessing other's salary (deny), Super Admin accessing anything (allow)
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3, 5.8, 5.9, 16.3_

- [ ] 6. Attendance and hours tracking
- [ ] 6.1 Build the 3-state attendance state machine with transition validation
  - Implement the state machine as a pure function: given current state and action, return new state or error
  - Valid transitions: IDLE→CLOCKED_IN, CLOCKED_IN→IDLE, CLOCKED_IN→ON_BREAK, ON_BREAK→CLOCKED_IN
  - Invalid transitions return an error message including the current state and last event timestamp
  - Support multiple sessions per day (after clock-out, can clock-in again)

  - _Requirements: 1.12, 7.2, 1.13_

- [ ] 6.2 (P) Build the configurable keyword matcher for multi-language attendance messages
  - Implement matching logic that takes a Slack message and an array of keyword configurations, returns the matched action or no-match
  - Support English and Japanese keyword sets: clock-in (hello, hi, おはよう), break (break, 休憩), back (back, 戻り), clock-out (bye, おつかれ)
  - Keywords stored as configurable data (not hardcoded), loadable from policy/config
  - Match should be case-insensitive and handle partial messages (keyword anywhere in text)
  - Also match language change commands (lang en, lang ja, 言語 en) and help commands (help, ヘルプ)
  - Write TDD tests for each language, mixed-language, no-match, case insensitivity, language/help commands
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.7, 1.10, 1.11_

- [ ] 6.3 Implement the attendance service that orchestrates event processing with idempotency and audit logging
  - Accept an attendance action with employee ID, timestamp, and source (slack/web)
  - Look up current state, validate transition, persist new event + updated state + audit entry as a single atomic operation

  - Cross-midnight rule: all hours for a session count toward the clock-in date
  - Weekly calculation: sum daily hours for Monday through Sunday
  - Monthly calculation: sum daily hours for the calendar month
  - Holiday adjustment: reduce required hours by the number of holidays in the period (fetched from holiday data)
  - Holiday work: hours worked on holidays count toward the monthly minimum at the standard 1.0x rate (no premium for Nepal contractors per flat monthly fee model). Holidays reduce required hours, but if someone works on a holiday, those hours still credit toward the reduced target and can generate surplus
  - Handle edge cases: open sessions (no clock-out), open breaks, multiple sessions per day, sessions shorter than configured minimum
  - Write TDD tests: normal day, cross-midnight, multiple sessions, holidays reducing requirements, holiday work at 1.0x, open session handling
  - _Requirements: 1.13, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 15.4, 7.9_

- [ ] 7. Leave management
- [ ] 7.1 Implement the leave service with request lifecycle, balance enforcement, and approval workflow
  - Create leave request: validate employee has sufficient balance for paid leave; reject with suggestion of unpaid/shift if balance is zero
  - Enforce no-negative-balance rule: paid leave blocked when balance reaches zero
  - Approval workflow: manager approves/rejects, system updates status, deducts balance for paid leave, creates audit entry
  - Support all leave types: paid, unpaid, shift permission, credited absence, and JP-specific types (bereavement, maternity, nursing, menstrual, company-specific)
  - Send notification to manager when request is created; notify employee on approval/rejection

  - _Requirements: 9.1, 9.3, 9.5, 9.7_

- [ ] 7.2 (P) Implement leave accrual calculation with policy-cascaded rules and carry-over logic
  - Accrual follows cascading policy: company default → group → employee
  - Nepal contractors: 1 day/month after 3-month probation, cap 20, forfeit on termination
  - Japan employees: JP labor law schedule (10 days at 6 months, scaling to 20 at 6.5 years), 2-year carry-over
  - Track mandatory 5-day annual leave usage for JP employees and generate warnings when insufficient days taken
  - Termination handling: NP contractors forfeit unused leave; JP employees follow labor law
  - Monthly accrual trigger: add days per policy, respect cap, handle carry-over expiry
  - Write TDD tests: NP accrual with probation gate, JP labor law schedule at various tenures, cap enforcement, carry-over expiry, mandatory 5-day tracking
  - _Requirements: 9.2, 9.4, 9.6_

- [ ] 8. Payroll and compensation
- [ ] 8.1 Implement the effective salary resolution that always reads from salary history, never current salary
  - Build getEffectiveSalary: query all salary history entries for employee, filter by entries effective on or before the last day of the target month, return the most recent entry's salary

  - Support all salary types: monthly (JPY/NPR), annual (divided by 12), hourly (for part-time)
  - Track salary changes as append-only audit trail with change types: INITIAL, PROBATION_END, REVIEW, PROMOTION, ADJUSTMENT
  - Each salary history entry can optionally link to a signed agreement document (S3 uploaded PDF) to satisfy the bilateral agreement requirement from HR policy
  - Write TDD tests: single salary lookup, mid-month blending, annual-to-monthly conversion, no history fallback, agreement document linkage
  - _Requirements: 10.1, 10.2, 10.9, 10.14, 16.7_

- [ ] 8.2 Implement the full monthly payroll breakdown calculation
  - Calculate base salary via getEffectiveSalary
  - Add pro-rata adjustment for mid-month join or exit: amount x (calendar_days_worked / total_calendar_days)
  - Add overtime pay based on hours exceeding policy threshold and applicable rates
  - Add allowances from cascading policy: transportation, housing, position, custom admin-defined types
  - Add bonus when applicable per cascading schedule (configurable timing: twice yearly, custom, or none)
  - Add commission for sales roles (externally input final amount)
  - Calculate deficit deduction for Nepal team: deficit_hours x hourly_rate, with the final monthly deduction total rounded UP (ceiling) to the nearest whole NPR — rounding applies to the monthly total, not per-hour or per-session
  - For non-JPY payments: record local currency amount, JPY equivalent, exchange rate, rate date, transfer fees, and net amount received
  - Build transparent breakdown showing every component for the payroll view
  - Write TDD tests: full NP payroll with deficit, full JP payroll with overtime and allowances, mid-month join pro-rata, blending, commission, exchange rate tracking

  - Pre-approval check: skip flag generation for dates with approved leave, credited absence, or manager pre-approval
  - Flag rules configurable per employment type via policy engine
  - Write TDD tests: daily shortfall with and without leave, weekly rollup, monthly deduction, pre-approval suppression, configurable thresholds

  - Resolution options: NO_PENALTY (forgive), DEDUCT_FULL (full salary deduction), USE_BANK (offset from surplus), PARTIAL_BANK (partial offset + partial deduction), DISCUSS (keep pending)
  - Bank offset: when manager selects USE_BANK or PARTIAL_BANK, apply specified hours from active (non-expired) bank entries to reduce the deficit
  - Update flag status, bank entry used hours, and create audit entry as a single atomic operation
  - Past deductions are final — no retroactive reversal from future surplus
  - Write TDD tests: each resolution type, bank offset reducing deficit to zero, partial bank offset, expired bank entries ignored
  - _Requirements: 11.2, 12.4_

- [ ] 9.3 (P) Implement hours banking with manager pre-approval, 12-month expiry, and visibility rules
  - Surplus hours require manager pre-approval before becoming bankable
  - Manager specifies max_leave_days convertible from the surplus when approving
  - Banked hours expire after 12 months from accrual date (configurable via policy)
  - Surplus is never cashable — only offset against deficits or converted to leave with manager permission
  - Unapproved surplus is hidden from the employee's view; only managers and RBAC-permitted users see it
  - Employees can request surplus banking approval from their manager
  - Write TDD tests: approval flow, expiry at 12 months, visibility rules by role, leave conversion within max_leave_days, expired entries excluded from offset
  - _Requirements: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.5_

- [ ] 9.4 (P) Implement quota redistribution with validation and termination settlement rules
  - Manager can redistribute hours across months (e.g., April 140h + May 180h = 320h total)
  - Validate redistributed totals equal the original standard total; if less, warn and allow with explicit manager acknowledgment
  - Salary remains the same for both months regardless of redistributed hours
  - Create linked override entries for each period in the plan
  - On termination during active redistribution: final settlement uses STANDARD hours (not redistributed) for the plan period
  - Write TDD tests: valid redistribution, under-total with warning, same salary both months, termination settlement using standard hours
  - _Requirements: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3_
