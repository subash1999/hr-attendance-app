# Product Context — HR Attendance App

## What Is This?
A full-stack HR management platform for the organization serving two teams:
- **Japan team** (~10 members): employees, contractors, part-time, sales, interns — Japanese labor law
- **Nepal team** (~15 members): independent contractors, paid/unpaid interns — Nepal Contract Act 2056

Replaces the existing Google Apps Script Slack bot with a proper web application backed by AWS, while keeping Slack as the primary daily interface (Kincone-style message-based attendance + daily reporting).

## Who Uses It?
- **All team members (Japan + Nepal)**: Clock in/out via Slack messages, submit daily reports via Slack, view dashboard on web
- **Managers**: Approve leave, resolve flags, view team data, manage quotas — scoped to direct reports
- **Admins/HR**: Full access, policy management, onboarding/offboarding, payroll, holiday calendars
- **CEO (Super Admin)**: Override any restriction, full organizational visibility

## Core Problems Solved
1. No proper database (currently Google Sheets)
2. No web UI for management/editing
3. Japan team has no HR system at all — different labor laws, overtime, social insurance
4. Slash commands feel unnatural vs Kincone-style message-based attendance
5. No scalable permission system (RBAC + ABAC needed)
6. No policy flexibility for different employment types and regions
7. Daily reports not tracked systematically, no JIRA/GitHub reference validation
8. No append-only audit trail for future LLM analysis

## Key Principles
1. **Slack is primary** for daily attendance + reporting (message-based, not commands)
2. **Web app is the management layer** — editing, dashboards, admin, policy builder
3. **Policy-as-data with cascade** — company → group → employee, static files first, DB later
4. **Everything configurable** — employment types, overtime rules, leave, bonuses, allowances, probation, holidays
5. **Append-only logging** — all user activity stored for audit trail and future LLM analysis
6. **No AI in v1** — hints and warnings from bot, but no Claude/AI backend processing
7. **Free/cheap deployment** — AWS free tier, ~$0-5/month
8. **TDD** — test-driven development, tests first
9. **Monorepo** — single repo, GitHub Actions CI/CD, dev + prod
10. **Single-tenant** — HR Attendance App only, not SaaS
