## 10. Multi-Region Considerations

### 10.1 Timezone Handling
- Japan team: JST (UTC+9) — same as current system
- Nepal team: NPT (UTC+5:45)
- All timestamps stored in UTC, displayed in user's local timezone
- "Today" and "this week" calculated per user's timezone

### 10.2 Currency
- Japan team: JPY (Japanese Yen)
- Nepal team: NPR (Nepalese Rupee)
- No currency conversion in the system — each operates independently

### 10.3 Same Slack Bot, Different Channels
- Single Slack bot serves both teams
- Different attendance channels per team/group
- Bot access configured manually per channel
- Channel-to-group mapping in system configuration
