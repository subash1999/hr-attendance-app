# Session Handoff — HR Attendance App

## Current State
- **Phase**: Design Generated + Validated (GO with 3 fixes applied)
- **Next action**: User reviews design.md, then `/kiro:spec-tasks hr-platform -y` to generate tasks
- **After tasks**: Run `./sync-to-drive.sh` to sync to NotebookLM

## What This Project Is
Full-stack HR platform for the organization replacing an existing buggy Google Apps Script Slack bot. Serves two teams:
- **Japan team** (~10 members): employees, contractors, part-time, sales, interns — Japanese labor law
- **Nepal team** (~15 members): independent contractors, paid/unpaid interns — Nepal Contract Act 2056

## Key Architecture Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) — Handler → Service → Repository, zero vendor lock-in
- **Stack**: AWS Lambda + API Gateway, DynamoDB (single-table, 2 GSIs), React 18 + Vite, TypeScript strict, Vitest TDD
- **Monorepo**: packages/core, types, data, api, slack, web, infra (npm workspaces)
- **packages/core**: Services + repository interfaces (ports) — ZERO AWS deps
- **packages/data**: DynamoDB/S3/SES/Cognito adapter implementations — shared by api and slack
- **Slack**: Message-based attendance ONLY (like Kincone app — user types "hello" to clock in, not slash commands). Also handles daily reports. All other features are web-only. Bolt.js + Node.js 20 (Node 24 incompatible).
- **Policy Engine**: 3-level cascade, S3 policy files (deployed from git `policies/` as seed), pure function resolver, web policy builder writes to S3 directly
- **Permissions**: RBAC (Employee, Manager, HR Manager, Admin, Super Admin) + ABAC (reporting chain, resource ownership, sensitivity)
- **Auth**: Cognito Lite tier (10K MAU free perpetually), CognitoAuthAdapter for onboarding/offboarding
- **i18n**: English, Japanese, Nepali
- **Theme**: HR Attendance App brand from example.com — black/white/cyan (#58C2D9), Silom font, light modern minimalist
- **Environments**: dev (develop branch) + prod (main branch), GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **No AI in v1**: Bot gives hints/warnings via regex pattern matching, no Claude/AI backend
- **Append-only audit logs**: All user activity stored for future LLM analysis
- **Email**: AWS SES for salary statements

## Spec Files (all under .kiro/)

## Gap Analysis Completed
- Validated requirements against existing slack-hr-bot codebase (no code to port — only spec docs exist)
- Validated against NotebookLM (HR policies, contracts)
- All gaps resolved and added to requirements (REQ-ATT-007/008, REQ-LEAVE-007, REQ-PAY-011-016, REQ-BANK-005, REQ-OB-004/005, REQ-QUOTA-002 updated, REQ-WEB-007/008, REQ-CRON-006/007)

## NotebookLM Integration
- Notebook ID: `hr-attendance-app-policies-slack-b`
- Contains: HR contracts, policies, all spec files
- Sync script: `./sync-to-drive.sh` copies all .md as .txt to Google Drive for NotebookLM
- **IMPORTANT**: After creating design.md and tasks.md, run `./sync-to-drive.sh` to sync to NotebookLM

## Existing Codebase Reference (DO NOT PORT CODE — it's buggy)
- `/Users/subash/Documents/CODING-SHARED/HR Attendance App/slack-hr-bot/docs/SCHEMA.md` — Data model reference (13 tables, getEffectiveSalary() algorithm)
- `/Users/subash/Documents/CODING-SHARED/HR Attendance App/slack-hr-bot/docs/DAILY_REPORTING_AND_HOURS_POLICY.md` — Hours calculation, flags, banking rules
- `/Users/subash/Documents/CODING-SHARED/HR Attendance App/slack-hr-bot/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` — Business logic formulas
- The existing bot has NO source code — only specification documents

## What To Do Next
1. ~~Run `/kiro:spec-design hr-platform`~~ DONE — design.md generated
2. ~~Run `/kiro:validate-design hr-platform`~~ DONE — GO decision, 3 fixes applied
3. User reviews design.md and approves
4. Run `/kiro:spec-tasks hr-platform -y` to generate tasks.md
5. Run `./sync-to-drive.sh` after tasks are created (sync to NotebookLM)
6. User reviews and approves tasks
7. Implementation begins with `/kiro:spec-impl hr-platform`
