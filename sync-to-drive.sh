# Sync all .md files from the project to Google Drive as .txt for Google Docs conversion
# Usage: ./sync-to-drive.sh [target-folder-name]
# Default target: hr-attendance-app inside Google Drive Sync Files
#
# After syncing:
#   1. Go to Google Drive > hr-attendance-app folder
#   2. Select all .txt files > Right-click > "Open with" > "Google Docs"
#   3. This creates Google Doc versions that NotebookLM can read
#   4. Add those Google Docs as sources in NotebookLM
#   5. On future syncs, the .txt files update and you re-open to refresh the Docs
